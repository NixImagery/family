# Tales of the family
I set this site up to share stories from my family: some of them are about me, of course, but there are others here. It's not really a family tree kind of thing, although there will be information from various family genealogists and contributors.

The site is at [cullaloe.com/family/](https://cullaloe.com/family/). 

I am a Lecturer and PhD student at Edinburgh University. I maintain an interest in programming, artificial intelligence and multimodal pedagogy, in particular, sound-based. You can find my current cv [here](https://github.com/NixImagery/CV/blob/master/cv.pdf) (pdf, 175kB).
