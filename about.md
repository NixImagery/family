{% newthought "I set this site up to share stories" %} from my family: some of them are about me, of course, but there are others here. It's not really a family tree kind of thing, although there will be information from various family genealogists and contributors.

{% marginnote "readme" "I retain some of his notes in the README for quick reference, but you should refer to his repository for further details for your own implementation." %}The site is at [cullaloe.com/family/](https://cullaloe.com/family/). It is based upon the [Tufte-Jekyll theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) by photographer and coder [Clay Harmon](http://www.clayharmon.com/). 

## Tufte and this site
This site uses the [Tufte Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) {% marginnote "jekyll" "[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a lightweight system for creating and deploying websites using Markdown, Liquid, HTML and CSS." %} by photographer and coder [Clay Harmon](http://www.clayharmon.com/), with a few modifications. It is hosted at [GitHub](https://cullaloe.com/family/).

{% marginnote "photo" "I also make photographs and post some of them at [photo.cullaloe.net](https://photo.cullaloe.net/), with more stories at [niximagery.com](https://niximagery.com)" %}I write a technical blog over at [cullaloe.com](https://cullaloe.com/), and run things like the [Natural Partners Project](https://naturalpartnersproject.org/) website.
