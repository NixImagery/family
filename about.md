{% newthought "In order to be more effective" %} at what I do{% sidenote "1" 'Principally, as a Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, I help people become outstanding modern teachers of physics and science.' %}, I engage in personal and professional development work. I keep a record of this work in a development diary. Until recently, until the winter of 2019, this was over at my wiki{% sidenote 2 '[cullaloe.net/w/](//cullaloe.net/w/)' %}. This new channel is easier to post to, and in my view, is prettier to look at.

## Tufte and this site
This site uses the [Tufte Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) {% marginnote "jekyll" "[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a lightweight system for creating and deploying websites using Markdown, Liquid, HTML and CSS." %} by photographer and coder [Clay Harmon](http://www.clayharmon.com/), with a few modifications. It is hosted at [GitHub](https://cullaloe.github.io/CPD-Log/) and at [my VPS](https://cullaloe.net/CPD-Log/).
