{% newthought "I set this site up to share stories" %} from my family, starting with [my mother](2020/03/29/Audrey-Bourne.html). It's not really a family tree kind of thing, although there will be information from various family genealogists and contributors.

## Tufte and this site
{% marginnote "readme" "I retain some of Clay's notes in the README for quick reference, but you should refer to his repository for further details for your own implementation." %}The site is based upon the [Tufte-Jekyll theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll)  {% marginnote "jekyll" "[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a lightweight system for creating and deploying websites using Markdown, Liquid, HTML and CSS." %} by photographer and coder [Clay Harmon](http://www.clayharmon.com/), with a few modifications. It is hosted at [GitHub](https://cullaloe.com/family/).

[Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) is a statistician and artist at Yale University. He wrote, designed, and self-published 4 classic books on data visualization. His ideas are the foundation for the design of the visual theme of this site, although there will not be much in the way of numerical data to visualise here - I just like how it looks, especially with images.

{% marginnote "photo" "I also make photographs and post some of them at [photo.cullaloe.net](https://photo.cullaloe.net/), with more stories at [niximagery.com](https://niximagery.com)" %}I write a technical blog over at [cullaloe.com](https://cullaloe.com/), and run things like the [Natural Partners Project](https://naturalpartnersproject.org/) website.
