## Synopsis

## Killed by Indians
More Hood family stories. My Grandfather Harry Straight Hood's Grandfather's Grandfather's Grandfather Jacob Straight (with me so far?) and his father, (also Jacob Straight) was murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV. One account reads:

"As it began to grow dark and Mrs. Dragoo and her son, who were out in the cornfield gathering beans, did not return to the house, they knew they had been captured. Jacob Strait and Nicholas Wood went to see if they could get any clue to their whereabouts, till they could get help from the fort. Strait and Wood had not gone very far until the Indians had shot Wood from ambush. Strait started to run, but the Indians dodged out in front of him stopping his flight. He held out his hands to them, showing them that he was not armed, and said, "I mean you no harm, don't kill me and I will go with you." The Indian gave him a grunt "Go with me" and raised the tomahawk and struck him. They took three scalps from his head. One from the top and one from each side of the back. He had black curly hair. The Indians were selling the scalps to the British. After the Indians left their victims, Mrs. Strait came out of her place of concealment and waded the river to the fort and gave the alarm...... Mrs. Dragoo and her little son, captured by the Indians were taken to Ohio, but Mrs. Dragoo could not travel as fast as they wanted to go, so one morning the boy was taken on ahead and told that his mother was ill and not able to travel. Later they told him his mother had died."

Mrs. Dragoo in the story was the victim's mother-in-law.
