## Synopsis
I was raised mostly in Letchworth, apart from a period in the USA before my mother was paralysed. After military service in REME, I pursued a career in Flight Simulation in the UK, Germany, Canada, the US and Far East before settling in my current home in Fife, Scotland. I became an educator in 2003 and now work at the University of Edinburgh in initial teacher education.

## REME
{% marginfigure 'nh-05' 'assets/img/Nick-05.png' '05 Platoon, Depot REME. I am the tall guy in the back row.'  %}I enlisted into the British Army in April 1976 and completed basic military training in the hot summer of that year. I was selected for the Avionics trade and went on to the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Arborfield. I served with the LADs REME at 70 Aircraft Workshop, Middle Wallop, and 656 Sqn AAC at the RAE, Farnborough. I was deployed on various exercises and operations including Op Agila in Rhodesia in 1979-80.
