    "text": "Synopsis\nGeneral John Bell Hood was a Confederate soldier who led in several significant but not always auspicious campaigns. The US Military camp at Fort Hood in Texas, is named for him1, as is Hood County, South-West of Fort Worth in Texas. Schools that once bore his name have long changed their mind about it.\n\n\n\nMemorial tribute at the Hennen family tomb, New Orleans\n\n\nThere are many tales of the soldier, mostly linked to either bravado, recklessness or insubordination, according to the teller. What emerges is a sense of John B. Hood as a maverick, respected by those he led, and a man who showed no great respect for protocols and dogma.\nAt the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, he was injured, permanently losing the use of his left arm. In September of that year, he lost his right leg after fracturing a femur: still he returned to service. In 1865, at the age of 33, John Bell Hood was the youngest man on either side of the American Civil War to be given command of an army.\nAfter the war and his military career, he began to write his memoirs as he established an insurance business, but was ruined and then killed by a Yellow Fever epidemic.",

A decade later, the county census has Lucille as the head of household and the four children living with her. His sister, Agnes Hood living with the family in 1930, is also absent from the 1940 census record for the household.\nHarry’s wife was killed in 1954 in a fire that broke out in a Pan-Am aircraft, according to the story I heard growing up, in a paint shop. She had escaped, but returned to rescue her friend who was still inside the fuselage. Harry married again later, to Irma. I met them both in Miami in the early 1980s, on a business trip to Tampa.\nHarry was at one time a Dade County councilman - I was told once that there was at one time a Harry S.

    "text": "The Bourne Family1 trace their lineage back to John Bourne, born in 1594 and married in Burstem, Stafford on 17th April 1626, according to records at FamilySearch. His second eldest, another John, born in Droitwich, near Worcester in 1629, begat William, 1671, in Nottingham; who fathered another William (1700), now of Westminster. There are gaps in the list of William’s children but there is a Thomas, born in 1628 in Westminster, and his son William (1751, Romford) who bring the line closer to credible recall. The documentary trail improves somewhat but there remains doubt when families procreate and spread.\nThese early records are full of contradictions, however, so cannot be taken literally. Not much more can be said for the recall of the living: even less for the careful recording of such recollections.\nStill, the line continues: this William had another William in 1781, who had, as they all did, many fruits of their loins, including one Alfred Bourne, born in Romford in 1825, who is father to George (1860, Stratford) and grandfather to George Alfred of certain memory and evidential relation. We seem to have ten generations or more from John Bourne of Droitwich, down through the Romford and Stratford Bournes, to George Alfred, who pushed his barrow North to the First Garden City and on to a new life for him and his family.\nMy maternal grandfather, George Frederick Bourne, is the too-cool dude with the cigarette in the back row of this image taken at his sister Kate Bourne’s wedding to Jack Mason in Letchworth in December 19282. Standing behind the bride is her father, one and the same George Alfred Bourne who pushed his barrow North to the First Garden City.",

Norah was, as was tradition in those days, quickly baptised at St Andrews, Grimsby, known as the Fisherman’s church (Andrew is their patron saint). That was a Church of England church, demolished in the 1960s but Norah said that she went to a convent school. She kept her faith without overtly practising until her death in 1979. I have the crucifix she was given as a girl.\nNorah’s mother was from Lowestoft in Suffolk, where William and Sarah lived for a while as they raised their family. William died during the second World War in 1942. There are family tales around his role in the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 and his encounter with the captain of a German U-boat. Sarah died in Canada in 1978, where a number of the Brennan family had emigrated after the war.\nNorah remained in England, finding her way to Letchworth where she met and married George Frederick Bourne in 1929. They had two children, Audrey and Michael. Audrey was my mother and I have happy memories of growing up in Letchworth and spending a lot of time with my grandparents, George and Norah. I stayed with them for a while when mum was paralyzed. “Nanna Bourne” was much loved by me and my cousins. She would have us all round the table on Sunday for a roast and 1966 was especially memorable because she took us all to the Costa Brava for a week. Nanna was quite fond of a beverage and on that holiday I remember she kept herself cool with Bacardi and Coke. There were many more memories of that trip, not least my mother’s encounter with the Spanish police, the football World Cup and plenty of banter with the Germans who were in a nearby pension. We went again the following year but not after, as my cousins and I moved up to our big schools and beyond.\nGeorge died of a blood clot one stormy December night in 1970, having battled progressive paralysis of his legs for a few years. Norah succumbed to what I think was cervical cancer almost ten years later.",

    "text": "Health\nAudrey became paralysed in August 1958, in her late twenties and was flown in a B-51 to the US military hospital at Wiesbaden, where she was told she would never walk again. In her own words, writing in 1994:\n\n“Those months [in Wiesbaden] were the most traumatic, and memorable of my young life. I was known as”The Duchess”, because once I had reached the wheelchair stage of my recovery some of the more mobile patients and I “held court” in the canteen during our coffee and tea breaks. No rude jokes were allowed. Major Turpin (the neurosurgeon) said they had closed the psychiatric department because of the stress-release effected during “court” sessions, where we confided all our problems to one another.”\n\nThe paralysis was identified as Transverse Myelitis. During her time in Wiesbaden, she received spinal injections, perhaps myelin, to which she attributed much of her spinal pain and mobility difficulties later in life. Interestingly, the study of how the myelin sheath repairs itself is now being considered as a clue to potential treatment for MS. She tried for years to unearth her medical records from the US National Records Office, but no such record of her treatment or attendance was ever found, with the suggestion that many such records were destroyed by a fire in a Seattle office. The paralysis was later attributed to Multiple Sclerosis.\nAudrey recovered enough to walk without a stick and returned to America to be with her son and husband, but this was short-lived and she became ill again, returning to England, so she thought, to die. She did not, and recovered at the hands of English doctors following the removal of a kidney. Her marriage to Ric did not survive this challenge, however, and they were eventually divorced in 1965. In time, she defied many medical and other challenges in her life, including the loss of an eye to a stupid man with a shoe horn.",

    "text": "George Alfred Bourne was born in West Ham in 1885 and was one of the first to settle in the First Garden City of Letchworth after it was founded by Ebenezer Howard in 1903. One of the attractions of the Garden City movement was the separation of industry and residential areas of a town, with the attendant health and productivity benefits.\nThe family stories tell how George walked from the East End of London - Stratford, Essex more truthfully, perhaps - to the new town for opportunity, pushing a barrow of possessions before him.\nThe Bourne family were entrepreneurial and soon established businesses including produce, grocery, transport and hospitality. George was responsible for a huge amount of the building which took place in Letchworth and his claim to fame was a very beautiful plastered ceiling in an iconic building in the town (the Spirella Building) for which he was responsible.",

George married Catherine Evans in 1904. They had three daughters and two sons.\n\n\n\nGeorge Bourne’s daughters. Catherine, Florence and Rosina.\n\n\nIn the family, I knew of the daughters as (Auntie) “Kit”, “Florrie” and “Rose”, but only remember Auntie Kit and Auntie Florrie. These two married (Jack Mason and Bert Downs, respectively) and settled in Letchworth.\nKit and Rose were born in Essex, but the eldest son, my grandfather George Frederick, was the first of the children born in Letchworth, in 1907, followed by Florence and, some time later, Albert.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nclassDef female fill:#fcc\nclassDef gentie fill:#fff\n\nGB(George Bourne&lt;br&gt;1860 -- 1909) --- GBREC[\"m. 1885\"]:::gentie\nREC(Rosina Elizabeth Chapman&lt;br&gt;1865 -- 1948):::female --- GBREC\nGBREC --- GAB\nGAB(George Alfred Bourne&lt;br&gt;1885 -- 1954) --- GABCEE[\"m. 1904\"]:::gentie\nCEE(Catherine Emma Evans&lt;br&gt;1884 -- 1940):::female --- GABCEE\nGABCEE --&gt; Kit(Catherine &lt;br&gt;1905 d):::female\nGABCEE --&gt; Rose(Rosina&lt;br&gt;1906 -- d):::female \nGABCEE --&gt; George(George Frederick&lt;br&gt;1907 -- 1970) \nGABCEE --&gt; Bunny(Florence &lt;br&gt;1909 -- 1985):::female\nGABCEE --&gt; Albert(Albert &lt;br&gt;1923 -- 1997) \nGBREC --- EB(Edward&lt;br&gt;1887 -- d.)\nGBREC --- CHB(Charles Henry&lt;br&gt;1887 -- 1961)\nGBREC --- AVB(Albert Victor&lt;br&gt;1891 -- 1953)\nGBREC --- RAB(Rosina Alice&lt;br&gt;1893 -- 1962):::female\nGBREC --- FAB(Florence Annie&lt;br&gt;1895 -- d.):::female\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine\n\n\n\nKate and Jack’s wedding, Letchworth, December 1928.\n\n\nKnown variously as Kate or Kit, Catherine married Jack Mason. I remember their house in Monklands, and the tiled fireplace that was common in the small cottages at that end of the town owned by the Howard Cottage Society. Their fireplace had an ornament that was a painted plaster cast model of a steam train leaving a tunnel, which captured my imagination - I could see an entire world beyond the fireplace, where the train came from.\nMy grandfather is in the back row of the wedding photo with a cigarette. Everybody smoked in those days.\n\n\nRosina\n\n\n\nRose and Percy’s wedding, Letchworth, I think, in 1926, before Kate and Jack.\n\n\nRose was the third named thus in the family group, after her grandmother and aunt. She married Percy Radford and (I think) lived in Barkway. Their daughter Jean married Clifford Arnold and their daughter is my cousin Jacky Joiner (née Arnold).\nMy grandfather, again in the back row, looking a little younger. George Alfred Bourne is again standing behind the bride.\n\n\nG. F. Bourne\nGeorge Frederick Bourne was my grandfather. He married Norah Brennan and lived in Bedford Road, opposite to my old junior school. He loved to drive; his car of choice in his later life was a Triumph Herald. He was crippled by something like Parkinson’s disease that eventually bound him to his bed on the ground floor of their home.\n\n\n\n\n\nBert and Florrie’s wedding in the local paper. It was Rosina’s husband who gave her away.\n\n\nHe had a number of business interests including a partnership with the Whiteheads, the Espresso Bar café on Station Road, Letchworth, and previously a transport business in the war. He drove the supply line throughout the London Blitzkrieg, for which the reward was the forced nationalisation by a Labour government of the business. He wept when they drove his lorries away.\n\n\nFlorence\nFlorrie married Bert Downs and lived on the corner of Archers Way and Haselfoot. I remember they kept corgis. Their daughter, Judith, married Derek Adams and they still live in Letchworth. The family had a long-standing relationship with the Spirella, the local factory that made everything from prams to parachutes, which is perhaps why their wedding warranted the strapline of, “Wedding of Spirella employee.” My mother, Audrey Bourne, is mentioned in the clip as one of the bridesmaids.\n\n\nAlbert\n\n\n\nFlorrie, Kate and Albert Bourne in Letchworth around 1928\n\n\nAlbert was George Alfred’s youngest son.",

This would have been around 1940. You can see George Bourne’s grocery van behind her in the photo. The Florence in the photograph’s mother was Florence Annie Bourne, sister of George Alfred and auntie to my grandfather (see the tree image). Florence Annie married John Thomas Rodbard and their children would have been Rodbards – Familysearch.org shows only John William Rodbard (b. 1915) but it’s quite possible that Florence King in the photo was his sister.\n\n\n\nFlorence Annie Rodbard née Bourne\n\n\nIt’s such a challenge in the Bourne family to work out who is who, because of their tradition of naming the first boy and girl after their parents. There are so many Georges and Rosinas in the Bourne family, it can be easy to get confused. Florence King (in the photo) was a refugee in the (second world) war, and stayed with Albert in Letchworth, when she got to know my mother, Audrey.",

My Grandfather Harry Straight Hood’s Grandfather’s Grandfather’s father1 Jacob Straight (with me so far?) was murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV. One account reads:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Historical Marker Database website. Image © J. J. Prats, June 21, 2014\n\n\n\n“As it began to grow dark and Mrs. Dragoo and her son, who were out in the cornfield gathering beans, did not return to the house, they knew they had been captured. Jacob Strait (sic.) and Nicholas Wood went to see if they could get any clue to their whereabouts, till they could get help from the fort. Strait and Wood had not gone very far until the Indians had shot Wood from ambush. Strait started to run, but the Indians dodged out in front of him stopping his flight. He held out his hands to them, showing them that he was not armed, and said,”I mean you no harm, don’t kill me and I will go with you.” The Indian gave him a grunt “Go with me” and raised the tomahawk and struck him. They took three scalps from his head. One from the top and one from each side of the back. He had black curly hair. The Indians were selling the scalps to the British. After the Indians left their victims, Mrs. Strait came out of her place of concealment and waded the river to the fort and gave the alarm. Mrs. Dragoo and her little son, captured by the Indians were taken to Ohio, but Mrs. Dragoo could not travel as fast as they wanted to go, so one morning the boy was taken on ahead and told that his mother was ill and not able to travel. Later they told him his mother had died.”",

Another story, from findagrave.com, adds information linking the Dragoo family to the raid, attributed to Shawnee Indians (the Jacob in the following story is not Jacob Straight, but Elizabeth’s maiden name was Straight, so this is still a family story).\n\n“When Jacob was about four years old, his mother Elizabeth was scalped and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, by about 9 Shawnee Indians, and his brother William (”Indian Billy”) Dragoo was also captured in this Indian raid, and he was then raised by the Indians. Elizabeth’s brother Jacob Straight, and a neighbor Nicholas Wood, were also killed in this raid. (Jacob’s mother Elizabeth was captured, and then scalped and killed later, at another location). Jacob’s brother William (“Indian Billy”) Dragoo later married an Indian squaw and became a “white” Chief of an Indian tribe.”\n\nThere is more of the story here, and a historical marker of the 1786 attack, in Marion County at the side of US 250.",
