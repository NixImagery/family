Norah was, as was tradition in those days, quickly baptised at St Andrews, Grimsby, known as the Fisherman's church (Andrew is their patron saint). That was a Church of England church, demolished in the 1960s but Norah said that she went to a convent school. She kept her faith without overtly practising until her death in 1979. I have the crucifix she was given as a girl.</p> <p>Norah's mother was from Lowestoft in Suffolk, where William and Sarah lived for a while as they raised their family. William died during the second World War in 1942. There are family tales around his role in the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 and his encounter with the captain of a German U-boat. Sarah died in Canada in 1978, where a number of the Brennan family had emigrated after the war.</p> <p>Norah remained in England, finding her way to Letchworth where she met and married George Frederick Bourne in 1929.

She would have us all round the table on Sunday for a roast and 1966 was especially memorable because she took us all to the Costa Brava for a week. Nanna was quite fond of a beverage and on that holiday I remember she kept herself cool with Bacardi and Coke. There were many more memories of that trip, not least my mother's encounter with the Spanish police, the football World Cup and plenty of banter with the Germans who were in a nearby pension.

Interestingly, the study of how the myelin sheath repairs itself is now being considered as a clue to potential treatment for MS. She tried for years to unearth her medical records from the US National Records Office, but no such record of her treatment or attendance was ever found, with the suggestion that many such records were destroyed by a fire in a Seattle office. The paralysis was later attributed to Multiple Sclerosis.</p>  <p>Audrey became paralysed in August 1958, in her late twenties and was flown in a B-51 to the US military hospital at Wiesbaden, where she was told she would never walk again.

I was known as \"The Duchess\", because once I had reached the wheelchair stage of my recovery some of the more mobile patients and I \"held court\" in the canteen during our coffee and tea breaks.

My Grandfather Harry Straight Hood's Grandfather's Grandfather's father1 Jacob Straight (with me so far?) was murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV. One account reads:</p>  <p>\"As it began to grow dark and Mrs. Dragoo and her son, who were out in the cornfield gathering beans, did not return to the house, they knew they had been captured. Jacob Strait (sic.) and Nicholas Wood went to see if they could get any clue to their whereabouts, till they could get help from the fort. Strait and Wood had not gone very far until the Indians had shot Wood from ambush. Strait started to run, but the Indians dodged out in front of him stopping his flight. He held out his hands to them, showing them that he was not armed, and said, \"I mean you no harm, don't kill me and I will go with you.\" The Indian gave him a grunt \"Go with me\" and raised the tomahawk and struck him. They took three scalps from his head. One from the top and one from each side of the back. He had black curly hair. The Indians were selling the scalps to the British. After the Indians left their victims, Mrs. Strait came out of her place of concealment and waded the river to the fort and gave the alarm. Mrs. Dragoo and her little son, captured by the Indians were taken to Ohio, but Mrs. Dragoo could not travel as fast as they wanted to go, so one morning the boy was taken on ahead and told that his mother was ill and not able to travel. Later they told him his mother had died.\"</p>","tags":["Straight","Dragoo","West Virginia"]},{"location":"Hood/2020-04-03-Jacob-Straight/#elizabeth-and-jacob-dragoo","title":"Elizabeth and Jacob Dragoo","text":"<p>Mrs. Dragoo in the story was the victim's mother-in-law.

Elizabeth's brother Jacob Straight, and a neighbor Nicholas Wood, were also killed in this raid. (Jacob's mother Elizabeth was captured, and then scalped and killed later, at another location). Jacob's brother William (\"Indian Billy\") Dragoo later married an Indian squaw and became a \"white\" Chief of an Indian tribe.\"</p>  <p>There is more of the story here, and a historical marker of the 1786 attack, in Marion County at the side of US 250. </p>","tags":["Straight","Dragoo","West Virginia"]},{"location":"Hood/2020-04-03-Jacob-Straight/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"Name DoB PoB DoD PoD     Jacob STRAIGHT 23 June 1741 NY 3rd October 1786 WV   Jacob DRAGOO 30 Sep 1782 VA 27 Sep 1838 MI      <ol> <li> <p>Corrected 5th April 2020, from GEDCOM data.
