It's not really a family tree kind of thing, although there will be information from various family genealogists and contributors. Please bear with me -- as retired folk soon forget, time is a precious and rare commodity when you're working in the first half of the twenty-first century. I've been \"doing family history\" all of my life from time to time, and have some stuff to draw upon, somewhere around here. Please get in touch if you have something to add or ask.

His second eldest, another John, born in Droitwich, near Worcester in 1629, begat William, 1671, in Nottingham; who fathered another William (1700), now of Westminster. There are gaps in the list of William's children but there is a Thomas, born in 1628 in Westminster, and his son William (1751, Romford) who bring the line closer to credible recall. The documentary trail improves somewhat but there remains doubt when families procreate and spread. These early records are full of contradictions, however, so cannot be taken literally. Not much more can be said for the recall of the living: even less for the careful recording of such recollections. Still, the line continues: this William had another William in 1781, who had, as they all did, many fruits of their loins, including one Alfred Bourne, born in Romford in 1825, who is father to George (1860, Stratford) and grandfather to George Alfred of certain memory and evidential relation. We seem to have ten generations or more from John Bourne of Droitwich, down through the Romford and Stratford Bournes, to George Alfred, who pushed his barrow North to the First Garden City and on to a new life for him and his family.

During her life, she lived mostly in Letchworth but traveled well, developing a good list of favourite places such as York and especially the Thames Valley around Henley. She wrote a number of novels and published a book of poetry. Audrey had a keen intellect and read extensively, most especially the diaries of Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn. Early Life Audrey in the Land Army, 1948. She went to Norton School, becoming Head Girl before leaving at 14 years old to begin working life during the final year of the Second World War at the Hertfordshire Rubber Company. According to Grace's Guide , this business made parts for the De Havilland Mosquito as part of the War Effort. At the age of around 18, Audrey served in the Land Army. She told the story of how, having unexpectedly returned to the farmhouse the girls were billeted in, she caught two of them in bed together. When she mentioned this to other girls, she was told, \"Don't worry, Audrey, they're Lezzies\", to which she replied, \"Who's Les?\" Audrey loved to swim and frequented the Art Deco Letchworth Lido all of her life, in recent years as part of a \"gang\" of Letchworth folk who met to chat, enjoy the atmosphere and swap memories of this great town institution. She worked there as a cashier there during the 1940's and 1950's. Family Audrey was married briefly to David Austin but bore her only child, Nicholas, to her second husband, Richard Neal Hood, a Staff Sergeant in the USAF. She was married four times to three husbands: twice to the rough diamond, charmer and criminal that was \"Frank\" Finlayson. Health Paralysis The paralysis was identified as Transverse Myelitis . During her time in Wiesbaden, she received spinal injections, perhaps myelin, to which she attributed much of her spinal pain and mobility difficulties later in life. Interestingly, the study of how the myelin sheath repairs itself is now being considered as a clue to potential treatment for MS . She tried for years to unearth her medical records from the US National Records Office, but no such record of her treatment or attendance was ever found, with the suggestion that many such records were destroyed by a fire in a Seattle office. The paralysis was later attributed to Multiple Sclerosis. Audrey became paralysed in August 1958, in her late twenties and was flown in a B-51 to the US military hospital at Wiesbaden, where she was told she would never walk again. In her own words, writing in 1994: \"Those months [in Wiesbaden] were the most traumatic, and memorable of my young life. I was known as \"The Duchess\", because once I had reached the wheelchair stage of my recovery some of the more mobile patients and I \"held court\" in the canteen during our coffee and tea breaks. No rude jokes were allowed. Major Turpin (the neurosurgeon) said they had closed the psychiatric department because of the stress-release effected during \"court\" sessions, where we confided all our problems to one another.\" Audrey recovered enough to walk without a stick and returned to America to be with her son and husband, but this was short-lived and she became ill again, returning to England, so she thought, to die. She did not, and recovered at the hands of English doctors following the removal of a kidney. Her marriage to Ric did not survive this challenge, however, and they were eventually divorced in 1965. In time, she defied many medical and other challenges in her life, including the loss of an eye to a stupid man with a shoe horn. Music Music followed her all of her life: she sang for pennies from her grandmother as a little girl, performed in \"The Wotsnames\" and sang from the roof of Letchworth fire station on VE day. With her friend, Brian Satterthwaite, she recorded a few tracks of favourite songs in a local studio. Here is one of those: \"Till we meet again\". Another one, a favourite of her mother's, \"We'll gather lilacs\", was played at her funeral on 14th April 2020 in Luton. Almost home Audrey, at home, July 2019, aged 89. Audrey almost made it to her 90th birthday which would have been on the 7th June, 2020. On Christmas Eve, 2019, she was admitted to hospital following a series of falls resulting from chronic pain and weakness in her knees, exacerbated by a viral infection she had picked up (or so she said) from a neighbour. Her stay became extended and required periods in rehab working with therapists on a bold plan to get her living semi-independently in her beloved home in Letchworth.

George Alfred Bourne was born in West Ham in 1885 and was one of the first to settle in the First Garden City of Letchworth after it was founded by Ebenezer Howard in 1903. One of the attractions of the Garden City movement was the separation of industry and residential areas of a town, with the attendant health and productivity benefits. The family stories tell how George walked from the East End of London - Stratford, Essex more truthfully, perhaps - to the new town for opportunity, pushing a barrow of possessions before him. George Bourne, with pigs. The Bourne family were entrepreneurial and soon established businesses including produce, grocery, transport and hospitality. George was responsible for a huge amount of the building which took place in Letchworth and his claim to fame was a very beautiful plastered ceiling in an iconic building in the town (the Spirella Building) for which he was responsible. Marriage and family George Bourne's daughters. Catherine, Florence and Rosina. George was the eldest of 6 children of George and Rosina (n\u00e9e Chapman) Bourne. Most of these stayed in London; his sister, also Rosina, emigrated to Canada. George married Catherine Evans in 1904. They had three daughters and two sons. In the family, I knew of the daughters as (Auntie) \"Kit\", \"Florrie\" and \"Rose\", but only remember Auntie Kit and Auntie Florrie. These two married (Jack Mason and Bert Downs, respectively) and settled in Letchworth. Kit and Rose were born in Essex, but the eldest son, my grandfather George Frederick, was the first of the children born in Letchworth, in 1907, followed by Florence and, some time later, Albert. Catherine Kate and Jack's wedding, Letchworth, December 1928. Known variously as Kate or Kit, Catherine married Jack Mason. I remember their house in Monklands, and the tiled fireplace that was common in the small cottages at that end of the town owned by the Howard Cottage Society. Their fireplace had an ornament that was a painted plaster cast model of a steam train leaving a tunnel, which captured my imagination - I could see an entire world beyond the fireplace, where the train came from. My grandfather is in the back row of the wedding photo with a cigarette. Everybody smoked in those days. Rosina Rose and Percy's wedding, Letchworth, I think, in 1926, before Kate and Jack. Rose was the third named thus in the family group, after her mother and aunt. She married Percy Radford and (I think) lived in Barkway. Their daughter Jean married Clifford Arnold and their daughter is my cousin Jacky Joiner (n\u00e9e Arnold). My grandfather, again in the back row, looking a little younger. George Alfred Bourne is again standing behind the bride. G. F. Bourne My grandparents, George Frederick and Norah Bourne George Frederick Bourne was my grandfather. He married Norah Brennan and lived in Bedford Road, opposite to my old junior school. He loved to drive; his car of choice in his later life was a Triumph Herald. He was crippled by something like Parkinson's disease that eventually bound him to his bed on the ground floor of their home. Bert and Florrie's wedding in the local paper. It was Rosina's husband who gave her away. He had a number of business interests including a partnership with the Whiteheads, the Espresso Bar caf\u00e9 on Station Road, Letchworth, and previously a transport business in the war. He drove the supply line throughout the London Blitz, for which the reward was the forced nationalisation by a Labour government of the business. He wept when they drove his lorries away. Florence Florrie married Bert Downs and lived on the corner of Archers Way and Haselfoot. I remember they kept corgis. Their daughter, Judith, married Derek Adams and they still live in Letchworth. The family had a long-standing relationship with the Spirella, the local factory that made everything from prams to parachutes, which is perhaps why their wedding warranted the strapline of, \"Wedding of Spirella employee.\" My mother, Audrey Bourne, is mentioned in the clip as one of the bridesmaids.

Her sister, Agnes Hood (sic.) living with the family in 1930, is also absent from the 1940 census record for the household. Harry was at one time a Dade County councilman - I was told once that there was at one time a Harry S.

My Grandfather Harry Straight Hood's Grandfather's Grandfather's father 1 Jacob Straight (with me so far?) was murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV. One account reads: \"As it began to grow dark and Mrs. Dragoo and her son, who were out in the cornfield gathering beans, did not return to the house, they knew they had been captured. Jacob Strait ( sic. ) and Nicholas Wood went to see if they could get any clue to their whereabouts, till they could get help from the fort. Strait and Wood had not gone very far until the Indians had shot Wood from ambush. Strait started to run, but the Indians dodged out in front of him stopping his flight. He held out his hands to them, showing them that he was not armed, and said, \"I mean you no harm, don't kill me and I will go with you.\" The Indian gave him a grunt \"Go with me\" and raised the tomahawk and struck him. They took three scalps from his head. One from the top and one from each side of the back. He had black curly hair. The Indians were selling the scalps to the British. After the Indians left their victims, Mrs. Strait came out of her place of concealment and waded the river to the fort and gave the alarm. Mrs. Dragoo and her little son, captured by the Indians were taken to Ohio, but Mrs. Dragoo could not travel as fast as they wanted to go, so one morning the boy was taken on ahead and told that his mother was ill and not able to travel. Later they told him his mother had died.\" Elizabeth and Jacob Dragoo Mrs. Dragoo in the story was the victim's mother-in-law. Her son in the story was William \"Indian Billy\" Dragoo. Another story, from findagrave.com , adds information linking the Dragoo family to the raid, attributed to Shawnee Indians (the Jacob in the following story is not Jacob Straight, but Elizabeth's maiden name was Straight, so this is still a family story). \"When Jacob was about four years old, his mother Elizabeth was scalped and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, by about 9 Shawnee Indians, and his brother William (\"Indian Billy\") Dragoo was also captured in this Indian raid, and he was then raised by the Indians. Elizabeth's brother Jacob Straight, and a neighbor Nicholas Wood, were also killed in this raid. (Jacob's mother Elizabeth was captured, and then scalped and killed later, at another location). Jacob's brother William (\"Indian Billy\") Dragoo later married an Indian squaw and became a \"white\" Chief of an Indian tribe.\" There is more of the story here , and a historical marker of the 1786 attack, in Marion County at the side of US 250.

Gen. John B. Hood John Bell Hood is a distant cousin who fought with distinction in the American Civil War. Some of this article is taken from his Wikipedia entry, which contains much more detail and references. Synopsis General John Bell Hood was a Confederate soldier who led in several significant but not always auspicious campaigns. The US Military camp at Fort Hood in Texas, is named for him 1 , as is Hood County, South-West of Fort Worth in Texas. Schools that once bore his name have long changed their mind about it. Memorial tribute at the Hennen family tomb, New Orleans There are many tales of the soldier, mostly linked to either bravado, recklessness or insubordination, according to the teller. What emerges is a sense of John B. Hood as a maverick, respected by those he led, and a man who showed no great respect for protocols and dogma. At the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, he was injured, permanently losing the use of his left arm. In September of that year, he lost his right leg after fracturing a femur: still he returned to service. In 1865, at the age of 33, John Bell Hood was the youngest man on either side of the American Civil War to be given command of an army. After the war and his military career, he began to write his memoirs as he established an insurance business, but was ruined and then killed by a Yellow Fever epidemic.
