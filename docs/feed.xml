She passed away on 20th March 2020 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synopsis&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey was born in Hitchin on the 7th June 1930 to Norah and George Bourne of Letchworth. She served in the &lt;label for=&quot;ajb-la&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;ajb-la&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/family/assets/img/Audrey-land-army.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey in the Land Army, around 1945.&lt;/span&gt;Land Army during the Second World War and worked at the Herts Rubber Company and Notts Dairy as a young woman. Audrey was married briefly to David Austin but bore her only child, Nicholas, to her second husband, Richard Neal Hood, a Staff Sergeant in the USAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audrey was paralysed in her late twenties and was flown to the US military hospital at Wiesbaden, where she was told she would never walk again. In time, she defied this and many other medical pronouncements in her life, in which she lost an eye and a kidney and suffered multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her life, she lived mostly in Letchworth but traveled well, developing a good list of favourite places such as York and especially the Thames Valley aroud Henley. She wrote a number of novels and published a book of poetry. Audrey had a keen intellect and read extensively, most especially the diaries of Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music followed her all of her life: she sang for pennies from her grandmother as a little girl, performed in “The Wotsnames” and sang from the roof of Letchworth fire station on VE day. With her friend, Brian Satterthwaite, she recorded a few tracks of favourite songs in a local studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one of those: &quot;Till we meet again&quot;. &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/787534222&amp;amp;color=%23444034&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jacob Straight</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Jacob Straight&lt;/span&gt;  was born on 23rd June 1741 in Richmond County, Staten Island NY and murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV in October 1786 with his father and Mother-in-law.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;killed-by-indians&quot;&gt;Killed by Indians&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Hood family stories. My Grandfather Harry Straight Hood’s Grandfather’s Grandfather’s Grandfather Jacob Straight (with me so far?) and his father, (also Jacob Straight) was murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV. &lt;label for=&quot;US250&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;US250&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;https://www.hmdb.org/Photos2/278/Photo278179.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Historical Marker Database website. Image © J. J. Prats, June 21, 2014&lt;/span&gt;One account reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As it began to grow dark and Mrs. Dragoo and her son, who were out in the cornfield gathering beans, did not return to the house, they knew they had been captured. Jacob Straight and Nicholas Wood went to see if they could get any clue to their whereabouts, till they could get help from the fort. Strait and Wood had not gone very far until the Indians had shot Wood from ambush. Strait started to run, but the Indians dodged out in front of him stopping his flight. He held out his hands to them, showing them that he was not armed, and said, “I mean you no harm, don’t kill me and I will go with you.” The Indian gave him a grunt “Go with me” and raised the tomahawk and struck him. They took three scalps from his head. One from the top and one from each side of the back. He had black curly hair. The Indians were selling the scalps to the British. After the Indians left their victims, Mrs. Strait came out of her place of concealment and waded the river to the fort and gave the alarm. Mrs. Dragoo and her little son, captured by the Indians were taken to Ohio, but Mrs. Dragoo could not travel as fast as they wanted to go, so one morning the boy was taken on ahead and told that his mother was ill and not able to travel. Later they told him his mother had died.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elizabeth-and-jacob-dragoo&quot;&gt;Elizabeth and Jacob Dragoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Dragoo in the story was the victim’s mother-in-law. Her son in the story was William “Indian Billy” Dragoo. Another story, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/17685794/jacob-dragoo&quot;&gt;findagrave.com&lt;/a&gt;, adds information linking the Dragoo family to the raid, attributed to Shawnee Indians (the Jacob in the following story is not Jacob Straight, but Elizabeth’s maiden name was Straight, so this is still a family story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When Jacob was about four years old, his mother Elizabeth was scalped and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, by about 9 Shawnee Indians, and his brother William (“Indian Billy”) Dragoo was also
captured in this Indian raid, and he was then raised by the Indians. Elizabeth’s brother Jacob Straight, and a neighbor Nicholas Wood, were also killed in this raid. (Jacob’s mother Elizabeth was captured, and then scalped and killed later, at another location). Jacob’s brother William (“Indian Billy”) Dragoo later married an Indian squaw and became a “white” Chief of an Indian tribe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=75089&quot;&gt;historical marker&lt;/a&gt; of the 1786 attack, in Marion County at the side of US 250.&lt;/p&gt;
