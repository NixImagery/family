        <title>Letchworth Bournes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;The Bourne family&lt;/span&gt;  are what was once called “Old Letchworth”, having lived in the town almost since it was founded as the First Garden City in 1903. Here is a synopsis of the how the Bourne family came to be called that.

He was quickly involved in the building which took place in Letchworth as the plans for a “Garden City”, in which housing and industry were separated for quality of life, unfolded. George brought his wife, Catherine, and their two children, Catherine and Rose, with him. They had three further children, all born in Letchworth: George Frederick, Florence, and Albert. He had a nose for business and ran a number of ventures, never afraid to get his hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;George Bourne, with pigs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/family/assets/img/George-Bourne-pigs.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;catherine&quot;&gt;Catherine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;kaf1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;kaf1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/family/assets/img/Kate-Albert-Florrie.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Florrie, Kate and Albert Bourne in Letchworth around 1928&lt;/span&gt;Known variously as Kate or Kit, Catherine married Jack Mason. I remember their house in Monklands, and the tiled fireplace that was common in the small cottages at that end of the town owned by the Howard Cottage Society. Their fireplace had an ornament that was a painted plaster cast model of a steam train leaving a tunnel, which captured my imagination - I could see an entire world beyond the fireplace, where the train came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kate and Jack's wedding, Letchworth, about 1928 (a guess). The cool dude in the back row with a fag is probably my grandfather, George, one of Kate's brothers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/family/assets/img/KateJackWeddingLetchworth.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rosina&quot;&gt;Rosina&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose was the third named thus in the family group, after her mother and aunt. She married Percy Radford and (I think) lived in Barkway. Their daughter Jean married (?) Arnold and their daughter is my cousin Jacky Joiner (née Arnold).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rose and Percy's wedding, Letchworth, I think, in 1926, before Kate and Jack. My grandfather, G.F. Bourne, (I think) again in the back row, looking a little younger.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/family/assets/img/Rose-Percy-Wedding-Letchworth.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;g-f-bourne&quot;&gt;G. F. Bourne&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;gan1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;gan1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/family/assets/img/George-Norah.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George and Norah&lt;/span&gt;George Frederick Bourne was my grandfather. He married Norah Brennan and lived in Bedford Road, opposite to my old junior school. He loved to drive; his car of choice in his later life was a Triumph Herald. He was crippled by something like Parkinson’s disease that eventually bound him to his bed on the ground floor of their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had a number of business interests including a partnership with the Whiteheads, the Espresso Bar café on Station Road, Letchworth, and previously a transport business in the war. He drove the supply line throughout the London Blitz, for which the reward was the forced nationalisation by a Labour government of the business. He wept when they drove his lorries away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;florence&quot;&gt;Florence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;downs1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;downs1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/family/assets/img/FlorenceBertDownsWeddingClipping.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bert and Florrie’s wedding in the local paper. It was Rosina’s husband who gave her away.&lt;/span&gt;Florrie married Bert Downs and lived on the corner of Archers Way and Haselfoot. I remember they kept corgis. Their daughter, Judith, married Derek Adams and they still live in Letchworth. The family had a long-standing relationship with the Spirella, the local factory that made everything from prams to parachutes, which is perhaps why their wedding warranted the strapline of, “Wedding of Spirella employee.” My mother, Audrey Bourne, is mentioned in the clip as one of the bridesmaids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;albert&quot;&gt;Albert&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert was George Albert’s youngest son.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Audrey Bourne</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;btw&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;btw&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Please note that I am adding to this page in the weeks following Audrey’s death, as I review family papers and photographs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Audrey was born in Letchworth&lt;/span&gt;  on the 7th June 1930 to Norah and George Bourne. During her life, she lived mostly in Letchworth but traveled well, developing a good list of favourite places such as York and especially the Thames Valley aroud Henley. She wrote a number of novels and published a book of poetry. Audrey had a keen intellect and read extensively, most especially the diaries of Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;early-life&quot;&gt;Early Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She went&lt;label for=&quot;ajb-la&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;ajb-la&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/family/assets/img/Audrey-land-army.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey in the Land Army, 1948.&lt;/span&gt; to Norton School, becoming Head Girl before leaving at 14 years old to begin working life during the final year of the Second World War at the Hertfordshire Rubber Company. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Hertfordshire_Rubber_Co&quot;&gt;Grace’s Guide&lt;/a&gt;, this business made parts for the De Havilland Mosquito as part of the War Effort. At the age of around 18, Audrey served in the Land Army. She told the story of how, having unexpectedly returned to the farmhouse the girls were billeted in, she caught two of them in bed together. When she mentioned this to other girls, she was told, “Don’t worry, Audrey, they’re Lezzies”, to which she replied, “Who’s Les?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audrey loved to swim and frequented the Art Deco &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/content/herts-history/towns-and-villages/letchworth_garden_city/letchworth_places/letchworth-lido&quot;&gt;Letchworth Lido&lt;/a&gt; all of her life, in recent years as part of a “gang” of Letchworth folk who met to chat, enjoy the atmosphere and swap memories of this great town institution. She worked there as a cashier there during the 1940’s and 1950’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;family&quot;&gt;Family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey was married briefly to David Austin but bore her only child, Nicholas, to her second husband, Richard Neal Hood, a Staff Sergeant in the USAF. She was married four times to three husbands: twice to the rough diamond, charmer and criminal that was “Frank” Finlayson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;health&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey became paralysed in her late twenties&lt;label for=&quot;par1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;par1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;August 1958. The paralysis was identified as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_myelitis&quot;&gt;Transverse Myelitis&lt;/a&gt; and later attributed to Multiple Sclerosis. During her time in Wiesbaden, she received spinal injections, perhaps myelin, to which she attributed much of her spinal pain and mobility difficulties later in life. Interestingly, the study of how the myelin sheath repairs itself is now being considered as a clue to &lt;a href=&quot;https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-news/2015/09/07/new-study-unravels-myelin-repaired-may-suggest-new-ms-treatments/&quot;&gt;potential treatment for MS&lt;/a&gt;. She tried for years to unearth her medical records from the US National Records Office, but no such record of her treatment or attendance was ever found, with the suggestion that many such records were destroyed by a fire in a Seattle office. &lt;/span&gt; and was flown in a B-51 to the US military hospital at Wiesbaden, where she was told she would never walk again. In her own words, writing in 1994:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Those months [in Wiesbaden] were the most traumatic, and memorable of my young life. I was known as &quot;The Duchess&quot;, because once I had reached the wheelchair stage of my recovery some of the more mobile patients and I &quot;held court&quot; in the canteen during our coffee and tea breaks. No rude jokes were allowed. Major Turpin (the neurosurgeon) said they had closed the psychiatric department because of the stress-release effected during &quot;court&quot; sessions, where we confided all our problems to one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audrey recovered enough to walk without a stick and returned to America to be with her son and husband, but this was short-lived and she became ill again, returning to England, so she thought, to die. She did not, and recovered at the hands of English doctors following the removal of a kidney. Her marriage to Ric did not survive this challenge, however, and they were eventually divorced in 1965. In time, she defied many medical and other challenges in her life, including the loss of an eye to a stupid man with a shoe horn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;music&quot;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music followed her all of her life: she sang for pennies from her grandmother as a little girl, performed in “The Wotsnames” and sang from the roof of Letchworth fire station on VE day. With her friend, Brian Satterthwaite, she recorded a few tracks of favourite songs in a local studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one of those: &quot;Till we meet again&quot;. &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/787534222&amp;amp;color=%23444034&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one, a favourite of her mother's, &quot;We'll gather lilacs&quot;, was played at her funeral on 14th April 2020 in Luton. &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/787592308&amp;amp;color=%23746c64&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;almost-home&quot;&gt;Almost home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;ajb-89&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;ajb-89&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/family/assets/img/Audrey-89.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey, at home, July 2019, aged 89.&lt;/span&gt;Audrey almost made it to her 90th birthday which would have been on the 7th June, 2020. On Christmas Eve, 2019, she was admitted to hospital following a series of falls resulting from chronic pain and weakness in her knees, exacerbated by a viral infection she had picked up (or so she said) from a neighbour. Her stay became extended and required periods in rehab working with therapists on a bold plan to get her living semi-independently in her beloved home in Letchworth. She almost made it again: on the day she was due to be discharged, she was admitted again to A&amp;amp;E with sepsis from an infection. She passed away on the morning of 20th March 2020 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow. Her ashes&lt;label for=&quot;mummy&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mummy&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;One of the last things she said to me was, “I want my mummy”. &lt;/span&gt; were scattered with her mother’s in the grounds of Luton Crematorium.&lt;/p&gt;

Gen. John B. Hood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;John Bell Hood&lt;/span&gt;  is a distant cousin who fought with distinction in the American Civil War. Some of this article is taken from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bell_Hood&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; entry, which contains much more detail and references.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synopsis&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General John Bell Hood was a Confederate soldier who led in several significant but not always auspicious campaigns. The US Military camp at Fort Hood in Texas, is named for him&lt;label for=&quot;fthood&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;fthood&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I was once destined for that place, having enlisted in the USAF to follow my father. I changed my mind and joined the British Army instead. &lt;/span&gt;, as is Hood County, South-West of Fort Worth in Texas. Schools that once bore his name have long changed their mind about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many tales of the soldier, mostly linked to either bravado, recklessness or insubordination, according to the teller. What emerges is a sense of John B. Hood as a maverick, respected by those he led, and a man who showed no great respect for protocols and dogma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, he was injured, permanently losing the use of his left arm. In September of that year, he lost his right leg after fracturing a femur: still he returned to service. In 1865, at the age of 33, John Bell Hood was the youngest man on either side of the American Civil War to be given command of an army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the war and his military career, he began to write his memoirs as he established an insurance business, but was ruined and then killed by a Yellow Fever epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family stories tell how George walked from London to the new town for opportunity, pushing a barrow of possessions before him. The Bourne family were entrepreneurial and soon established businesses including produce, grocery, transport and hospitality. George was responsible for a huge amount of the building which took place in Letchworth and his claim to fame was a very beautiful plastered ceiling in an iconic building in the town (the Spirella Building) for which  he was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marriage-and-family&quot;&gt;Marriage and family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George was the eldest of 6 children of George and Rosina (Chapman) Bourne. Most of these stayed in London; his sister, also Rosina, emigrated to Canada. George married Catherine Evans in 1904. They had three daughters and two sons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;George Bourne's daughters. Catherine, Florence and another Rosina. In the family, I knew of these women as (Auntie) &quot;Kit&quot;, &quot;Florrie&quot; and &quot;Rose&quot;, but only remember Auntie Kit and Auntie Florrie. These two married (Jack Mason and Bert Downs, respectively) and settled in Letchworth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/family/assets/img/George-Bourne-daughters.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kit and Rose were born in Essex, but the eldest son, George Frederick, was the first of the children born in Letchworth, in 1907, followed by Florence and, some time later, Albert.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nick Hood</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Nicholas Robin Hood&lt;/span&gt;  was born on 16th June 1957 at Wimpole Park Hospital, Arrington to Audrey and Ric Hood. He lives in Fife with his wife, Kara.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;synopsis&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was raised mostly in Letchworth, then, after military service, I pursued a career in flight simulation and software development in Europe, North America and the Far East, settling in Scotland. I became an educator in 2003 and now work at the University of Edinburgh in initial teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;early-life&quot;&gt;Early life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;nh-tod&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;nh-tod&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/family/assets/img/Nick-toddler.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicky - passport photo.&lt;/span&gt;I lived with my parents, except for a short period when Mum was paralysed. My Dad was posted to the US, so we followed him there and spent time in Hialeah. Mum’s illness was hard for their marriage and they eventually divorced and Dad made a new life with another English girl. I remember telling my friends at school about it: such a thing was rare in those days. I grew up in Letchworth, the first garden city and still pretty in places even today. I went to Icknield Infant School, Wilbury Junior School across from my Grandad and Nanna Bourne’s house on Bedford Road, and Letchworth Grammar School.&lt;/p&gt;

I am the tall guy in the back row.&lt;/span&gt;I enlisted into the British Army in April 1976 and completed basic military training in the hot summer of that year. I was selected for the Avionics trade and went on to the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Arborfield. I served with the LADs REME at 70 Aircraft Workshop, Middle Wallop, and 656 Sqn AAC at the RAE, Farnborough. I was deployed on various exercises and operations including Op Agila in Rhodesia in 1979-80.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jacob Straight</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Jacob Straight&lt;/span&gt;  was born on 23rd June 1741 in Richmond County, Staten Island NY and murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV in October 1786 with his father and Mother-in-law.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;killed-by-indians&quot;&gt;Killed by Indians&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Hood family stories. My Grandfather Harry Straight Hood’s Grandfather’s Grandfather’s father&lt;label for=&quot;err1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;err1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Corrected 5th April 2020, from GEDCOM data. This story used to be a generation out. Turns out that the Indian massacre is closer than I previously thought. The boy in the story was Indian Billy Dragoo - see below for more about him. &lt;/span&gt; Jacob Straight (with me so far?) was murdered by Indians in Monongalia County, WV. &lt;label for=&quot;US250&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;US250&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;https://www.hmdb.org/Photos2/278/Photo278179.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Historical Marker Database website. Image © J. J. Prats, June 21, 2014&lt;/span&gt;One account reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As it began to grow dark and Mrs. Dragoo and her son, who were out in the cornfield gathering beans, did not return to the house, they knew they had been captured. Jacob Strait (&lt;em&gt;sic.&lt;/em&gt;) and Nicholas Wood went to see if they could get any clue to their whereabouts, till they could get help from the fort. Strait and Wood had not gone very far until the Indians had shot Wood from ambush. Strait started to run, but the Indians dodged out in front of him stopping his flight. He held out his hands to them, showing them that he was not armed, and said, “I mean you no harm, don’t kill me and I will go with you.” The Indian gave him a grunt “Go with me” and raised the tomahawk and struck him. They took three scalps from his head. One from the top and one from each side of the back. He had black curly hair. The Indians were selling the scalps to the British. After the Indians left their victims, Mrs. Strait came out of her place of concealment and waded the river to the fort and gave the alarm. Mrs. Dragoo and her little son, captured by the Indians were taken to Ohio, but Mrs. Dragoo could not travel as fast as they wanted to go, so one morning the boy was taken on ahead and told that his mother was ill and not able to travel. Later they told him his mother had died.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elizabeth-and-jacob-dragoo&quot;&gt;Elizabeth and Jacob Dragoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Dragoo in the story was the victim’s mother-in-law. Her son in the story was William “Indian Billy” Dragoo. Another story, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/17685794/jacob-dragoo&quot;&gt;findagrave.com&lt;/a&gt;, adds information linking the Dragoo family to the raid, attributed to Shawnee Indians (the Jacob in the following story is not Jacob Straight, but Elizabeth’s maiden name was Straight, so this is still a family story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When Jacob was about four years old, his mother Elizabeth was scalped and killed in an Indian raid in 1786, by about 9 Shawnee Indians, and his brother William (“Indian Billy”) Dragoo was also
captured in this Indian raid, and he was then raised by the Indians. Elizabeth’s brother Jacob Straight, and a neighbor Nicholas Wood, were also killed in this raid. (Jacob’s mother Elizabeth was captured, and then scalped and killed later, at another location). Jacob’s brother William (“Indian Billy”) Dragoo later married an Indian squaw and became a “white” Chief of an Indian tribe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more of the story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Straight-233&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=75089&quot;&gt;historical marker&lt;/a&gt; of the 1786 attack, in Marion County at the side of US 250.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harry S. Hood</title>

Hood, his son Charles, and two of Charles’ daughters, Luci and Linda, in Miami, 1961.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Harry Straight Hood&lt;/span&gt;  was born on 8th April 1903 in West Virginia. He was the last in the family to follow the tradition of bearing his mother’s surname (Straight) as his middle name.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;family&quot;&gt;Family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Straight Hood was born on 8th April 1903 in West Virginia and died in Dade County, Florida, at the age of 86. He was married to Mary Lucille Long and had four children: Elizabeth (Betty-Ann), Eleanor, Charles (Jack), and Richard (Ric).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family lived in Harrison County, West Virginia, where the 1930 census record shows that Harry worked as a motor mechanic. A decade later, the county census has Lucille as the head of household and the four children living with her. Her sister, Agnes Hood (sic.) living with the family in 1930, is also absent from the 1940 census record for the household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- His wife was killed in a fire that broke out in a Pan-Am aircraft - she had escaped, but returned to rescue her friend who was still inside the fuselage. Harry married again, Irma. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry was at one time a Dade County councilman - I was told once that there was at one time a Harry S. Hood building in Hialeah, standing in his honour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parents&quot;&gt;Parents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry’s parents were Harry Hood and Malinda Ann Straight.&lt;/p&gt;
