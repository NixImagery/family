<p><span class="newthought">The Bourne family</span>  are what was once called “Old Letchworth”, having lived in the town almost since it was founded as the First Garden City in 1903. Here is a synopsis of the how the Bourne family came to be called that.

<p><label for="gblorry1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="gblorry1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/family/assets/img/G-Bourne-lorry.jpg" /><br />A Bourne venture.</span>George Bourne is said to have walked from the East End of London - Stratford, Essex more truthfully, perhaps - pushing a barrow of possessions before him. He was quickly involved in the building which took place in Letchworth as the plans for a “Garden City”, in which housing and industry were separated for quality of life, unfolded. George brought his wife, Catherine, and their two children, Catherine and Rose, with him. They had three further children, all born in Letchworth: George Frederick, Florence, and Albert. He had a nose for business and ran a number of ventures, never afraid to get his hands dirty.</p>

<p><label for="kaf1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="kaf1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/family/assets/img/Kate-Albert-Florrie.jpg" /><br />Florrie, Kate and Albert Bourne in Letchworth around 1928</span>Known variously as Kate or Kit, Catherine married Jack Mason. I remember their house in Monklands, and the tiled fireplace that was common in the small cottages at that end of the town owned by the Howard Cottage Society. Their fireplace had an ornament that was a painted plaster cast model of a steam train leaving a tunnel, which captured my imagination - I could see an entire world beyond the fireplace, where the train came from.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Kate and Jack's wedding, Letchworth, about 1928 (a guess). The cool dude in the back row with a fag is probably my grandfather, George, one of Kate's brothers.</figcaption><img src="/family/assets/img/KateJackWeddingLetchworth.jpg" /></figure>

<h3 id="rosina">Rosina</h3>
<p>Rose was the third named thus in the family group, after her mother and aunt. She married Percy Radford and (I think) lived in Barkway. Their daughter Jean married (?) Arnold and their daughter is my cousin Jacky Joiner (née Arnold).</p>

<figure><figcaption>Rose and Percy's wedding, Letchworth, I think, in 1926, before Kate and Jack. My grandfather, G.F. Bourne, (I think) again in the back row, looking a little younger.</figcaption><img src="/family/assets/img/Rose-Percy-Wedding-Letchworth.jpg" /></figure>

He married Norah Brennan and lived in Bedford Road, opposite to my old junior school. He loved to drive; his car of choice in his later life was a Triumph Herald. He was crippled by something like Parkinson’s disease that eventually bound him to his bed on the ground floor of their home.</p>

<p>He had a number of business interests including a partnership with the Whiteheads, the Espresso Bar café on Station Road, Letchworth, and previously a transport business in the war. He drove the supply line throughout the London Blitz, for which the reward was the forced nationalisation by a Labour government of the business. He wept when they drove his lorries away.</p>

It was Rosina’s husband who gave her away.</span>Florrie married Bert Downs and lived on the corner of Archers Way and Haselfoot. I remember they kept corgis. Their daughter, Judith, married Derek Adams and they still live in Letchworth. The family had a long-standing relationship with the Spirella, the local factory that made everything from prams to parachutes, which is perhaps why their wedding warranted the strapline of, “Wedding of Spirella employee.” My mother, Audrey Bourne, is mentioned in the clip as one of the bridesmaids.</p>

<p>Albert was George Albert’s youngest son.</p>
