## ...we got a code 404

{% marginfigure '404' '/assets/img/404.jpg' 'Audrey Bourne, her grandfather and a chicken, Letchworth, around 1933.' %}Don't panic. It's just that we can't find that page at the moment, sorry. It might be here, but we just can't lay our hands on it at the moment, maybe because the page link address has changed.

The best thing to do is look for the name you were seeking [here]({{site.baseurl}}/categories.html), or look at the [most recent posts]({{site.baseurl}}/). If you followed a link from another site, it would be nice if you told the operators of that site about this error so they can update their links.

### Whilst you're here

The photo on this page was taken around 1933, probably in Common View, Letchworth Garden City. It shows Audrey Bourne carrying one of her grandfather's chickens. In those days, the family kept animals and fed themselves from the land, either at home or on an allotment. Soon after this picture was taken, Hitler would lead us into another great war and such skills were essential for the people to sustain themselves and prevail.
