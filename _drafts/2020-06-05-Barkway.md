{% maincolumn 'assets/img/BarkwayCottages167901.jpg' "Family photographs from the collection of Audrey Bourne included some taken in Barkway some time in the 1920's, of Bournes and Pecketts at work on the harvest, or posing for a snap. This photo of Barkway cottages shows how the village has changed, and how it hasn't: the thatched cottage on the left is still there today." %}

## The Barkway connection
Grandad and Grandma Peckett moved from Stratford some time after the 1911 census. They had 7 children, including Vi, and her elder sister Lilian, who married Albert Victor Bourne, my great-grandfather's younger brother.
