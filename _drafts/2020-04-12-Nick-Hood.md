## Synopsis
I was raised mostly in Letchworth, then, after military service, I pursued a career in flight simulation and software development in Europe, North America and the Far East, settling in Scotland. I became an educator in 2003 and now work at the University of Edinburgh in initial teacher education.

## Early life
{% marginfigure 'nh-tod' 'assets/img/Nick-toddler.jpg' 'Nicky - passport photo.'  %}I lived with my parents, except for a short period when Mum was paralysed. My Dad was posted to the US, so we followed him there and spent time in Hialeah. Mum's illness was hard for their marriage and they eventually divorced and Dad made a new life with another English girl. I remember telling my friends at school about it: such a thing was rare in those days. I grew up in Letchworth, the first garden city and still pretty mostly even today. I went to Icknield Infant School, then Wilbury Junior School across from my Grandad and Nanna Bourne's house on Bedford Road, and Letchworth Grammar School.

## REME
{% marginfigure 'nh-05' 'assets/img/Nick-05.png' '05 Platoon, Depot REME. I am the tall guy in the back row.'  %}I enlisted into the British Army in April 1976 and completed basic military training in the hot summer of that year. I was selected for the Avionics trade and went on to the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Arborfield. I served with the LADs REME at 70 Aircraft Workshop, Middle Wallop, and 656 Sqn AAC at the RAE, Farnborough. I was deployed on various exercises and operations including Op Agila in Rhodesia in 1979-80.

## Flight simulation
I left the military after a fairly short service to chase a new adventure working on the Lynx helicopters in Quatar which didn't work out. Looking back, it seemd like a good idea at the time but I was somehow protected from it. Imagine how life might have been had I stayed in the Gulf. I spent a year driving taxis, selling business machines, hair transplants and life assurance, finally landing a job as a Systems Design Engineer at Rediffusion in Crawley. This gave me the technical challenge I needed, and the travel I craved. I learned to code, properly, building on the foundations I laid in the Army learning COBOL by correspondence. I worked on Tristar, B757 and B767 flight simulators and travelled to where these were installed, in the USA, Japan and Europe.

## Scotland
I learned to fly.
